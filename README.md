# Stock Selection and News Fetcher

This project is a Go-based tool designed for selecting stocks based on a gap percentage, calculating potential profits from stock price movements, and fetching relevant news articles about selected stocks from Seeking Alpha. The tool outputs a list of selected stocks along with their positions and associated news articles in JSON format.

## Features

- **Stock Selection:** 
  - Loads stock data from a CSV file.
  - Filters stocks based on their gap percentage.
  - Calculates entry price, stop loss, take profit, and potential profit for each selected stock.
  
- **News Fetching:** 
  - Fetches relevant articles from Seeking Alpha API for each selected stock ticker.
  
- **JSON Output:**
  - The results are saved in a JSON file, which includes stock tickers, calculated positions, and associated articles.

## Requirements

- Go (v1.16 or higher)
- Access to the Seeking Alpha API (via RapidAPI)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-selection-news-fetcher.git
cd stock-selection-news-fetcher
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Ensure you have Go installed. The code requires no additional external dependencies other than the Go standard library.

### 3. API Key

To fetch articles from Seeking Alpha, you'll need a RapidAPI key for their service. Obtain your API key and replace the placeholder in the `apiKey` constant in the `main.go` file.

```go
const apiKey = "your-rapidapi-key-here"
```

### 4. Prepare CSV File

Create or download a CSV file (e.g., `opg.csv`) with stock data. The CSV should have the following columns:

- `Ticker` (e.g., AAPL)
- `Gap Percentage` (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
- `Opening Price` (e.g., 150.0)

### 5. Run the program

Once everything is set up, you can run the program using:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will:

1. Load stock data from the `opg.csv` file.
2. Filter stocks based on the gap percentage.
3. Calculate potential positions for each stock.
4. Fetch relevant news articles from Seeking Alpha.
5. Save the results in a JSON file named `opg.json`.

## Example Output

The output JSON file (`opg.json`) will contain an array of stock selections, each including:

- `Ticker`: Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL).
- `Position`: Calculated position details, including entry price, stop loss, take profit, and profit.
- `Articles`: List of articles with publishing date and headline.

### Example:

```json
[
  {
    "Ticker": "AAPL",
    "Position": {
      "EntryPrice": 150.00,
      "Shares": 100,
      "TakeProfitPrice": 160.00,
      "StopLossPrice": 140.00,
      "Profit": 1000.00
    },
    "Articles": [
      {
        "PublishOn": "2024-12-06T08:00:00Z",
        "Headline": "Apple Stock Hits New High"
      },
      {
        "PublishOn": "2024-12-05T09:00:00Z",
        "Headline": "Apple Unveils New Product"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
